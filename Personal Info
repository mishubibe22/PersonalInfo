Hey, I know you are still young and sometimes confused about things. 
It's okay to make mistakes and not to know everything yet.
You are learning and growing  every single day.

There will be days when you feel sad or tired.
Don't give up, because those hard days will make you stronger.
One day, you will thank yourself for not giving up.

Keep being kind and don't lose your smile.
Believe in yourself even others doubt you.
Everything will work out in the right time.
